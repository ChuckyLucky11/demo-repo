Skill Builder - Part 1

My name is Joseph Chandler Miller, and I am a senior in Electrical Engineering at Mississippi State.
I am the treasurer at Farmhouse Fraternity, where I spend much of my free time. I greatly enjoy the
outdoors, and I have attained the rank of Eagle Scout in Boy Scouts. I plan to work in electrical engineering
consulting once I have finished my bachelor's degree.
